## To Run:

<!-- Working example here: https://warm-chamber-83596.herokuapp.com/

`NPM start` from the server folder will start the server and serve the front end on request.

You can also run the server and front end seperately. To run the front end `NPM serve` in order to run via the Vue-Cli.

## Authentication:

All requests to a secured end point will go through a JWT middleware `token.check`. If an invalid or missing token is recieved a error message will be returned in a json response.

Example Request Header:

	Authorization : Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJfaWQiOiI1Yâ€¦EzNX0.EvrI6zeEwcmunonqt1ocPw-dzyoY-ZCUOqsLoPC1FDU

On successfull authorization the payload of the JWT will be available from `request.body.token.clean` or the raw string at `request.body.token.raw`.



## Authentication Blacklist:

All failed tokens are added to a token blacklist in the database.
Every time a user logs out or updates user details their current token is also added to the token blacklist.
Tokens are removed from the blacklist once they have expired by date.
