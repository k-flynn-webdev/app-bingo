BINGO:

TODO:

want to possibly be able to play back how the won happened and by who? for now go for easier.


create user
	users cards (owned)
	users participation
		simple version would be just link to cards played?
		users wins
		users ticked items
	
create anom user
	given a unique id
	must give a name

create card
	set name
	add items



every card needs:
	
	- card name
	- card unique url (short, nice and shareable)
	- card creation date
	- card owner + id? (could be anom)
		owner:  -name -id -email
	- card items


	card items:
		- text


	during play:
		- card id and instance no
		- progress / length
 			the instance is the multi-player in play, we only need to fire a win state back to server if they select all items.	
 			we need to alert to a loss state if someone wins back to those still playing. Also if someone is close to winning we should send a mini alert about that.


cards are masters in their own right, they just happen to have an owner which is secondary.
Cards can be copied but the original link will be killed so its a new unique card.
each card handles its players? joiners, anoms?

cards will be killed/archived after a month of inactivity. can only be re-opened by a real user.


if someone is playing as anon and decide they like the game, signing up creating a user account should be seamless and save their activity?



TODO:

figure out instance scope?

	- Person creates a game
	- Game is created and link sent back + offered?
	- Person makes a request to link address
		- random instance id created if not specified?
		- instance is created on server 

		the id it's self doesnt matter, it's just a signature if you want to join a group they'd all have the same id thats made up.

			- Instance is then sent back as data?
				- Anyone reqesting with that ID will join THIS instance.


player creates
board is created				
link sent back
player joins from that link + (no id), no id specified is given a new instance
player joins from that link + (id), joins current instance played

all players updates will be PINGED back to THIS instance
when someone wins this instance alerts on the ping. GAme is over and will be shutdown either after 1 day of inactivity or 1 hour after the win.






new idea:


needs:

get board data
create board data
update board data
delete board data

board create new instance
board join random instance
board join specific instance

board get instance progress
board send client progress


Create/Editing/Removing a board:
	post:/api/board/create
	get:/api/board/board-id
	put:/api/board/board-id
	delete:/api/board/board-id


Getting/Joining rando or specific instance:
	get:/api/instance/board-id/create
	get:/api/instance/board-id/random
	get:/api/instance/board-id/instance-id


Getting Sending instance info:
	get:/api/instance/instance-id

	player join (body info)
	post:/api/instance/instance-id

	player update (body info)
	put:/api/instance/instance-id

	player leave (body info)
	delete:/api/instance/instance-id


first player to join is Admin, when they leave board is shutdown completely.



players send:
	- unique id
	- animal icon?
	- current score
	- words selected


server sends on update:
	- highest score (anon)
	- on win, which animal + id
	- which words selected by everyone
